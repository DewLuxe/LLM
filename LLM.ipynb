    "# Lesson 6: Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of data in Python. Here, you will see how text and numbers are used in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are used to store and manipulate text. As you see here, strings are written inside of quotes and can contain letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and other special characters. Run the following cells to print these four different strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"My favorite drink is Earl Grey tea.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"2.99\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiline strings\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use triple quotation marks, you can store a multiline string. These strings can span more than one line. When you run the following cell, you will see how the spaces in the second line are actually read as characters for the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"\"\"Hello, World!\n",
    "      It's great to be here!\"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to define a multiline string using single quotes will lead to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World!\n",
    "      It's great to be here!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## The type() function\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can check the type of any data that you are using. To check the data type, you can use the `type()` function. When you run the next cell, you will retrieve the type for the string `\"Andrew\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "type(\"Andrew\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Python returned `str`, which is short for string. Let's check the type for a multiline string:\n",
    "\n",
    "type(\"\"\"\n",
    "Numbers, text, and truth,\n",
    "Strings, ints, and floats in our code,\n",
    "Data shapes our path\n",
    "\"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This also returns `str`, since it is also a string. Let's try a number within quotation marks:\n",
    "\n",
    "type(\"2.99\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also a string, even though it looks like a number. By using quotation marks you're telling Python to treat it as text, rather than a number. What about a number without quotes?\n",
    "\n",
    "type(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "This time you get `int`, which is short for integer. Integers are the positive and negative whole numbers, like 42, 100, -9, and 0. Since there are no quotes around the number Python assumes this is numerical data, and since there is no decimal place on this number, it interprets it as an integer. Now, let's try a number that does have decimal places:\n",
    "\n",
    "type(2.99)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function type gives `float`, which is the data type used to store floating point numbers. Floating point numbers are positive and negative numbers that include a decimal place, like 3.14, 2.99, and -0.003. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python as a calculator!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python works great for quick arithmetic operations. For instance, if you had a lemonade stand, and wanted to compute the total number of sales you made through the last 12 months, you can use Python like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(28+35+43+50+65+70+68+66+75+80+95)\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, you can perform more advanced math, like computing the compound interest after 10 years at a rate of 5%. To do that, you can compute 1.05 to the power of 10. Not sure how to do it in Python? You can use the Chatbot!\n",

    "### Order of operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of operations in Python is the same as in arithmetic. First, you compute parentheses, then exponents, then you multiply and divide (from left to right), and finally, you add and subtract (from left to right). \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you are trying to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, the following cell will give you an incorrect answer:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Mixing strings with computations or data: f-Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to display the equivalent degrees Celsius to a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, you would do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(((75 - 32) * 5 / 9))\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you wanted to display that degrees conversion using a string that included the computation, you could try:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"The temperature 75F in degrees Celsius is ((75 - 32) * 5 / 9)C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "But that doesn't work. It gives you back the formula, but it doesn't actually convert from degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius. \n",
    "\n",
    "To print the result of the computation within that string rather than just the formula, you can use what is called an <b>f-string</b> in Python which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"The temperature 75F in degrees celsius is {(75 - 32) * 5 / 9}C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "There, I have written `f` (for formatted) before the quotation marks that denote a string, and I included the computation within curly braces `{(75 - 32) * 5 / 9}`. The `f` character tells Python that the subsequent string has data or computations within any pair of curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Determining how data is displayed in f-strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through another example. You can print Isabel's age as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Isabel is 28 years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In some countries, there exists the concept of dog age. Since people live longer than dogs on average, someone's dog age is supposed to be one-seventh of their real human age. So, if you wanted to compute and display Isabel's dog age in a readable way, you wouldn't use a regular string like the one below.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Isabel is 28/7 dog years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you would use an f-string that includes the dog age equivalency computation as in the temperature conversion example.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Isabel is {28/7} dog years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you see that the last print statement did work, but it displayed the number with one decimal place. What if you wanted to display a whole number, which is much more natural when speaking about ages? You can use the chatbot to answer that question.

    "\n",
    "In `f\"{28/7:.0f}\"`, the `:.0f` part tells Python to display the result of `28/7` without any decimal places. You don’t need to worry too much about the details, but the `f` in `:.0f` indicates that the number is a floating-point number and should be formatted accordingly. This means it will be rounded to the nearest whole number and displayed without any decimal part.\n",

    "## Multi-line f-strings\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you have worked with strings that have a relatively small length. For lengthy strings, you will use multi-line strings, which are easier to read in a code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following multi-line f-string includes a description of how Americans use measurements in units that are not in the metric system. It displays the equivalent milliliters (ml) for 8 fluid ounces of milk and the equivalent fluid ounces to 100 ml of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"\"\"\n",
    "    Most countries use the metric system for recipe measurement, \n",
    "    but American bakers use a different system. For example, they use \n",
    "    fluid ounces to measure liquids instead of milliliters (ml).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    So you need to convert recipe units to your local measuring system!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, 8 fluid ounces of milk is {8 * 29.5735} ml.\n",
    "    And 100ml of water is {100 / 29.5735} fluid ounces.\n",
    "\"\"\")\n",
    "\n",
    "As you see there, you have to use triple quotes `\"\"\"` instead of single quotes `\"` for multi-line strings, and you have multiple lines with text and computations; but besides that, everything works pretty much the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the way you are using f-strings right now is not that easy to read. All those numbers inside the curly braces don't let you see at a glance what the output is going to be, and if you have lots of calculations, it can be distracting.\n",

    "# Lesson 3 - Prioritizing tasks with dictionaries and AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will explore dictionaries, a data structure that helps you store key-value pairs. The main difference with list, is that dictionaries assign a key to each values instead of an index. Let's start by importing some functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "from helper_functions import print_llm_response, get_llm_response\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to store ice cream flavor descriptions using lists, you would have something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "ice_cream_flavors = [\n",
    "    \"Vanilla: Classic and creamy with a rich, smooth flavor from real vanilla beans.\",\n",
    "    \"Chocolate: Deep and indulgent, made with rich cocoa for a satisfying chocolate experience.\",\n",
    "    \"Strawberry: Sweet and fruity, bursting with the fresh taste of ripe strawberries.\",\n",
    "    \"Mint Chocolate Chip: Refreshing mint ice cream studded with decadent chocolate chips.\",\n",
    "    \"Cookie Dough: Vanilla ice cream loaded with chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough.\",\n",
    "    \"Salted Caramel: Sweet and salty with a smooth caramel swirl and a hint of sea salt.\",\n",
    "    \"Pistachio: Nutty and creamy, featuring the distinct taste of real pistachios.\",\n",
    "    \"Cookies and Cream: Vanilla ice cream packed with chunks of chocolate sandwich cookies.\",\n",
    "    \"Mango: Tropical and tangy, made with juicy mangoes for a refreshing treat.\",\n",
    "    \"Rocky Road: Chocolate ice cream mixed with marshmallows, nuts, and chocolate chunks.\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to look up the description for a particular flavor, you would have to memorize its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building intuition and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are very similar to the dictionaries you would find in a library. Each value in a dictionary is associated with a key, just as you will find definitions associated to words in a hardcover dictionary. Let's take as an example the following dictionary with ice cream flavors.\n",
    "\n",
    "ice_cream_flavors = {\n",
    "    \"Mint Chocolate Chip\": \"Refreshing mint ice cream studded with decadent chocolate chips.\",\n",
    "    \"Cookie Dough\": \"Vanilla ice cream loaded with chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough.\",\n",
    "    \"Salted Caramel\": \"Sweet and salty with a smooth caramel swirl and a hint of sea salt.\"\n",
    "}   \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ice_cream_flavors` dictionary has keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(ice_cream_flavors.keys())\n",
    "\n",
    "and values:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(ice_cream_flavors.values())\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries don't index their elements as list do, so you cannot access values in the way you would using lists. If you run the cell below, you will get an error message since the index 0 is not a key in the `ice_cream_flavors` dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "#Wrong way of accessing elements (treating dict as a list)\n",
    "print(ice_cream_flavors[\"Mint Chocolate Chip\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's ask the chatbot how to access items in this dictionary.\n",
    "\n",

    "} <br>\n",
    "</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "So, to access the values in the dictionary you need to use its keys. For instance, for `Cookie Dough`, you can run the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "cookie_dough_description = ice_cream_flavors[\"Cookie Dough\"]\n",
    "print(cookie_dough_description)\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's take another look at the `ice_cream_flavors` dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "print(ice_cream_flavors)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to add a new item for the `\"Rocky Road\"` flavor, you will need to assign its definition to `ice_cream_flavors[\"Rocky Road\"]` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "ice_cream_flavors[\"Rocky Road\"] = \"Chocolate ice cream mixd witother ngredients.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you are using the same syntax that selects a single item, but this time use a key that didn't exist before and assign it a value. Let's check the dictionary after this update:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(ice_cream_flavors)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can update existing dictionary items in a similar way. Let's fix the typos from the `\"Rocky Road\"` description.\n",

    "# Lesson 6: Turning code blocks into reusable functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this and the previous courses, you have been using several different **functions**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll learn how to create your own, and see how they can help you avoid writing lines of code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the helper functions you'll use:\n",
    "\n",
    "from helper_functions import print_llm_response\n",
    "from IPython.display import Markdown, display\n",
    "\n",
    "## Revisiting functions you've already used\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the functions you've encountered so far in these courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print` function displays data to the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The `len` function returns the number of items, or elements, in a list:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Return the number of friends in the list\n",
    "len(friends_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "And you've been using a special helper function called `print_llm_response` to pass prompts to an LLM and display the response to screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The 'print_llm_response' function is in the helper_functions.py file\n",
    "print_llm_response(\"What is the capital of France\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining your own functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining functions can help you avoid typing the same code over and over. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to read in the text from different food journals, you'd need to repeat the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "# read in the Cape Town journal\n",
    "f = open(\"cape_town.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "journal_cape_town = f.read()\n",

    "\n",
    "If you need to load multiple files, you'll have to repeat these three lines for each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, you can instead define a **function** to read in a file and store the contents to a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_journal(file):\n",
    "    f = open(file, \"r\")\n",
    "    journal = f.read()\n",
    "    f.close()\n",
    "    print(journal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have created this function, you can reuse it to read in different files:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read in the Sydney journal\n",
    "print_journal(\"sydney.txt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a function that **returns** a variable, rather than printing to screen:\n",
    "\n",

    "    f = open(file, \"r\")\n",
    "    journal = f.read()\n",
    "    f.close()\n",
    "    # print(journal)\n",
    "    return journal\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `read_journal` function to store the contents of the Tokyo journal in a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "journal_tokyo = read_journal(\"tokyo.txt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Print out the Tokyo journal content:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "print(len(journal_tokyo))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters in functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you saw how to use Python to carry out calculations that convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Value of temperature in Fahrenheit\n",
    "fahrenheit = 72\n",
    "# Calculation for getting the temperature in Celsius\n",
    "celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the results\n",
    "print(f\"{fahrenheit}°F is equivalent to {celsius:.2f}°C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to convert another temperature, you have to write the code again, replacing the value for the ```fahrenheit``` variable with the new temperature to convert:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Value of temperature in Fahrenheit\n",
    "fahrenheit = 68\n",
    "# Calculation for getting the temperature in Celsius\n",
    "celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the results\n",
    "print(f\"{fahrenheit}°F is equivalent to {celsius:.2f}°C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this as many times as you need\n",
    "\n",
    "# Value of temperature in Fahrenheit\n",

    "# Calculation for getting the temperature in Celsius\n",

    "# Print the results\n",
    "print(f\"{fahrenheit}°F is equivalent to {celsius:.2f}°C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is a lot of typing! You can avoid this by writing a function for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius. Here is the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):\n",
    "    # Calculation for getting the temperature in celsius\n",
    "    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9\n",
    "    # Print the results\n",
    "    print(f\"{fahrenheit}°F is equivalent to {celsius:.2f}°C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of changing the value of the ```fahrenheit``` variable directly each time, you'll pass the desired value to the function as a ***parameter***. A parameter is a variable that is used in functions to pass in information to the function - in this case the temperature in Fahrenheit that you want to covert to Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the ```fahrenheit_to_celsius``` function and pass in a temperature as the input parameter!\n",
    "\n",
    "fahrenheit_to_celsius(71)\n",
    "\n",
    "fahrenheit_to_celsius(70)\n",
    "\n",
    "fahrenheit_to_celsius(212)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Returning values\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to save the result from the temperature conversion function, you need to include a ```return``` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a modification of the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function that returns the converted temperature as a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):\n",
    "    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9\n",
    "    # print(f\"{fahrenheit}°F is equivalent to {celsius:.2f}°C\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Return the calculated value (not to print it, as before)\n",
    "    return celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you run this function, the result is stored in a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The value of temperature in Fahrenheit is 45\n",
    "fahrenheit = 45\n",
    "celsius = fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now print the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(celsius)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this function returns a number, in this case a `float`:\n",

    "\n",
    "import helper_functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this, you must five the name of the file *and* the name of the function, separated by a `.` character:\n",
    "\n",
    "helper_functions.print_llm_response(\"What is the capital of France?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you must include the `.` for this to work. For example, if you want to use `get_llm_response` - which is also defined in `helper_functions.py` - and you try the following code, it won't work:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🚨 Alert: running the next cell will return an error!\n",
    "\n",
    "response = get_llm_response(\"What is the capital of France?\")\n",

    "\n",
    "response = helper_functions.get_llm_response(\"What is the capital of France?\")\n",
    "print(response)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another way to import all of the functions in a file that avoids the `.` notation above. You can use a `*` character and the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "from helper_functions import *\n",
    "\n",
    "This imports all the functions in a file and makes them available without `.` notation.\n",

    "\n",
    "# It worked!\n",
    "print(response)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Using the `from file import *` notation can cause unexpected results in some cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it is recommended to only load what you need (e.g. `from helper_functions import print_llm_response`), or to import that whole file and use the `.` notation. "
